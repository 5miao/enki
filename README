Roboblog is a compact, easily extendable base for your blog. It does this by being highly opinionated, for example:

- Public facing views should adhere to standards (XHTML, Atom)
- /yyyy/mm/dd/post-title is a good URL for your posts
- Live comment preview by should be provided by default
- You don't need a plugin system when you've got decent source control
- If you're not using OpenID you're a chump
