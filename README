= Enki

A ruby on rails blogging engine for the fashionable developer.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME YET

Preferences are for the masses. Any real coder knows the easiest and best way to customize something is by hacking code. Because you want your blog to be you, not bog standard install #4958 with 20 posts per page instead of 15. For this you need a clean, simple, easy to understand code base that stays out of your way. No liquid drops and templates hindering your path, no ugly PHP stylings burning your eyeballs.

== Quick Start

  git clone http://repo.or.cz/w/enki.git
  cd enki
  git checkout -b myblog # Create a new work branch
  git cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
  git cp config/defensio.example.yml config/defensio.yml # Will not be required in the future
  # Edit config/enki.yml to taste
  rake spec

== More info

Roboblog is a compact, easily extendable base for your blog. It does this by being highly opinionated, for example:

- Public facing views should adhere to standards (XHTML, Atom)
- /yyyy/mm/dd/post-title is a good URL for your posts
- Live comment preview by should be provided by default
- Google does search better than you or I
- You don't need a plugin system when you've got decent source control
- If you're not using OpenID you're a chump
