= Facets Change History

== 2.2.1 / 2007-12-22

* Got rid of methods subdir. All method redirects are in core/.

== 2.2.0 / 2007-12-13

* A lot of rdoc updates to core extensions --as promised ;)
* Just about every method now has at least a brief explinaiton and an example.
* integer/bitmask.rb has changed a bit --pun intended ;) Deprecated some methods and now use "~" instead of "-" to clear bits.
* The name Array#unzip didn't makes sense, it was renamed to #modulate (though #collate seems better?)
* Renamed Enumerable#collate to #mash (Map hASH); #collate and #graph remain aliases for the time being.
* Deprecated Module#include_and_extend. Just use both silly.
* More lib pp_s.rb has been removed. Use #pretty_inspect instead.
* Split binding extensions up a bit more finely --eval.rb sprouted here.rb, self.rb and defined.rb.
* Move Time#stamp out of conversion.rb and into time/ dir, and remove to_s alias.
* Preliminary addition of Matthew Harris' excellent duration.rb lib (will integrate with times.rb better in future).
* Added if clauses to handle upcoming Ruby 1.9 gracefully. Facets should now be just about ready for use with 1.9.

== 2.1.3 / 2007-11-28

* Fixed minor oddity in Enumerable/collate.
* Fixed major issue with 2.1.2 where it would not core facets correctly.

* command.rb has been completely rewritten. The API has changed completely!
* There is no longer a Commmand::Optoins class. Use Console::Arguments instead.
* Added BiCrypt class to crypt.rb for simple two-way encyrption.
* module/attr.rb now has attr_reader!, attr_writer! and attr_accessor!
* All attr_xxx methods have coresponding alias_xxx methods.
