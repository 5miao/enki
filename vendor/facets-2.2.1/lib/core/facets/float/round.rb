# Conceptually, rounding is one expects to apply to floating point numbers.
# However it can actually be applied to prettu much and Numeric object.
# For example, one could round an Integer to the nearest kilo. So the
# actual round.rb lib is in the numeric folder, but we'll add this tub 
# here for convenience.
